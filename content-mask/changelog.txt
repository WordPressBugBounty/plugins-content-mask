* Fixed a bug where the <title> tag wasn't showing up when using the iframe method.

= 1.4.3.1 =
* Removed the Cache Refresh option in the Content Mask Admin page for Masks set to Iframe and Redirect (since those methods aren't cacheable)
* Reverted the change made in 1.4.2 and moved the Page Processing function back to the template Redirect Hook. It was causing issues with homepage redirection.
* Password protection and removal have extraneous scripts has been added to this version of the Page Processing function as well.

= 1.4.3 =
* Content Masked pages now respect the Password Protected visibility status.
* When a Content Masked page is Password Protected, it shows the default page with the standard password form. Once the password is successfully submitted, the Content Mask will perform as usual.
* Removed superfluous and/or commented out code that's no longer used.

= 1.4.2 =
* To speed up Content Mask time, the page processing function has been moved to an earlier hook.
* Redundant URL Validity checks have been removed.
* Title has been linked in the Content Mask admin list for ease-of-use.
* Scripts and Styles that are hooked in an unorthodox manner are now killed before rendering a Content Masked page, this will speed up the page, prevent unwanted styles and scripts from being loaded, prevents JS errors from unrelated plugins being thrown in the console.

= 1.4.1 =
* Modified the Content Mask admin page table layout
* The Mask URL column is now linked and clickable.
* Cache Expiration column has been added.
* Cache may be refreshed by clicking on Refresh in the Cache Expiration column (shows on row hover).

= 1.4 =

= 1.3 =
* Underthe hood improves with custom field variable extraction.
* Improved SVG icon clarity.
* Added Content Mask column to Page and Post edit lists which allows an at-a-glance preview of whether Content Mask is enabled, and which type; as well as allowing an Ajax button-press to enable or disable the Content Mask (like on the Content Mask overview admin page).

= 1.2.2 =
* Minor changes to prevent undefined variable and similar E_NOTICE level errors from appearing when debug mode was enabled.
* Removed dependency from external CSS in the admin, namely FontAwesome and Line Icons.
* Prevented irrelevant meta field checks when not strictly necessary.

= 1.2.1 =
* Behind the scenes improvement with the plugin name and label
* Addressed CSS issues with plugins that used the @keyframes name "check"
* Prevented the `process_page_request` function from firing in non singular instances. Post lists and archive pages were firing the first content mask they ran across.
* Replaced the $cm instance variable with a private variable to eliminate namespace conflicts

= 1.2 =
* Added Content Mask admin page that shows a list of all current Content Masks that the logged in user is allowed to edit. Each row displays all the pertinent info for each Content Mask, and allows a one-click interface to disable or enable it.
* Using the Download method will now replace all relative URLs from the Content Mask URL with an absolute URL. This includes all `src`, `href` and `action` attributes. Protocol relative and existing absolute URLs are unaffected, but this should allow for significant improvements to consistency, especially with local form actions and local image & script libraries.
* Some fluff code has been removed from the front end of the Iframe method.

= 1.1.4.2 =
* Forgot to remove class methods that were no longer in use, which triggered E_NOTICE errors in some sites.

= 1.1.4.1 =
* Content Mask URL's without a protocol have `http://` added to them, since not all sites are secure yet. However, if your site is secure, it won't display `http://` iframes. Iframe method now checks if your site is secured with ssl, and if so force updates the Content Mask URL's protocol to `https://`. If the content still is blank, it's because the iframe'd site is insecure and wouldn't show up either way. 

= 1.1.4 =
* If other (namely really large) metaboxes were hooked in, Content Mask Settings were hard to see. Moved inline CSS and JS to separate files and improved the design of the metabox to make it stand out much more when buried deeply in the admin.

= 1.1.3 =
* Elegant Theme's "Bloom" was interfering and still being hooked. It's now been forcefully unhooked on Content Mask pages (regardless of content displayed)

= 1.1.2 =
* Made Content Mask Method an array to allow for easier updating/additions in the future

= 1.1.1 =
* Provided better URL validation on the front end

= 1.1.0 =

* Added custom sanitization functions for text (URL) inputs, select boxes, and checkboxes.
* Escaped post meta field values when returned in the admin and front-end.

= 1.0.1 =
* Initial Public Repository Release
